# Project Name : Coder international summit

> This is my fist capstone project for the end module one in `Microverse` program. Note that this website is based on an online website for a conference. `Microverse` provide some design guidelines for me to create this website, but I personalize the content to be `coder interational summit` that is internation summit of all code writers (designers, developers,..) and happens each 2 years.
> - Note yet avialable on the web.
>
